<h1>About</h1>

<pre>
A Core Banking System (CBS) is the central "brain" of a bank that processes
all daily transactions and updates accounts in real-time.
It connects all branches and digital channels to a single database, allowing customers
to access their funds and manage accounts from anywhere, regardless of where they originally opened them.
